## Notes

Challenge that I faced was with installing Xcode, I had Yosemite installed on my mac because of which I couldn’t install Xcode and had to update my os before I can proceed. Other than that even with no IOS programming experience I was able to create the basic app with required functionality easily. Looking forward to attend the class and learn more.
